# Code of Conduct

These guidelines apply to all official development communication channels
(GitHub, Slack, mailing lists, discord, forums) and activities that take place
on secondlife.com and in-world and are provided in addition to Second Life's
general [Community Standards][].

Reports of violations can be sent to opensource-moderators@lindenlab.com and
will get handled on a case by case basis. Debate about infractions is always
off-topic in our mailing lists and forums.

We recognize that misunderstandings and mistakes can happen. We will only take
actions after repeated intentional violations.

#### Be respectful and considerate:

- Disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior or personal attacks.
- Remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable is not a productive
  one.

#### Be patient and generous:

- If someone asks for help it is because they need it.
- Do politely suggest specific documentation or more appropriate venues where
  appropriate, but avoid aggressive or vague responses.

#### Assume people mean well:

- Remember that decisions are often a difficult choice between competing
  priorities.
- If you disagree, please do so politely.
- If something seems outrageous, check that you did not misinterpret it.
- Ask for clarification, but do not assume the worst.

#### Help others help you:

- When asking a question, meet others halfway. Let them know what you've already
  tried or where you've already looked.
- Be respectful of others' time. Follow the advice in [How to Ask Smart Questions][smart].

#### Try to be concise:

- Avoid repeating what has been said already.
- Making a conversation larger makes it difficult to follow, and people often
  feel personally attacked if they receive multiple messages telling them the
  same thing.
